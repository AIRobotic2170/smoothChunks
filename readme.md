<h1 align="center">Smooth Chunks</h1>
<p align="center">Chunk loading in Minecraft can be very jagged when they appear out of nowhere. With this mod, you can configure a nice animation for how chunks load in to your world.</p>

<h1 align="center">Abandoned ⚠️</h1>
I'm no longer maintaining this project. You can see why ![here](https://github.com/cadenkriese/smooth-chunks/issues/9#issuecomment-1345925713). A much better mod that does the same thing and more can be found ![here](https://modrinth.com/mod/chunks-fade-in). As a side note, be kind to developers and creators who do things for free :)

## Incompatibilities

Unfortunately the mod is incompatible with Sodium and OptiFine/OptiFabric at this time. I'd like to add support for them eventually though. I also assume that the mod is incompatible with many other rendering focused mods such as Canvas, though I haven't tested it.
